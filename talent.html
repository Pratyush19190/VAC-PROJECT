                <h2>Determined to learn</h2>
                <p>Developing our people is a key pillar of our culture at PageGroup and is critical to the success of our business. That’s why we take it seriously. PageGroup offers a clear and transparent career journey and provides the support and development needed for people to reach their potential. Through a market leading, blended learning approach our employees can learn through a variety of materials including video, infographics, interactive e-learning, gamification, and virtual and physical classroom sessions.</p>
                <p>From the moment our people join us, whatever their level of experience, there’s a clear development pathway all the way to the top, starting with our global on-boarding programme which brings new starters quickly up to speed on who we are, what we do, our values, and how best to grow their business.</p>
                <p>“My training was really intensive but invaluable. Learning on the job is also essential.<br>
                    You have to share the responsibility for learning.”</p>
